
<div class="panel" ng-controller='HomeCtrl' >
  <h1 class="masthead-brand">A directive for scrolling large sets of data.</h1>

  <p >
  Below you see you a list of {{total}} elements. Each time when the cached display set is out of
  reach a call will be made retrieve more data. (Currently we simulate a 2 second timeout and return a set).
  </p>

  <p>
  Note that infinite is not really infinite, you can really only display around 2147483645 / height of your template. So in this sample
  we could go upto 700k rows, after that things will just not work.
  </p>

  <!-- And here you have the directive in action -->
  <!-- Make sure to put it inside a fixed height & width, otherwise it will not work properly -->
  <!-- Not setting position to relative  causes weirdness with the scrollbars -->
  <h3> Let's scroll {{total}} elements..
    <small ng-show='loading'>
      Loading
      <i  class="fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>
    </small>
  </h3>
  <div style="position: relative; width: 300px; height: 300px;"> 

    <!-- Notice the ' around the template! -->
    <infinite-list request-data="getData" row-template="'<p>[{{item}}]</p>'" /> 
  </div>
</div>
